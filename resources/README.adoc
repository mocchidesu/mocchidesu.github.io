# Local Signature project (SecretBuddy)

## Motivation
Signatuire generation is a key concept of App2App authentication, however, there's no simple tool available.  
We ask to use SignatureGenerate.java for even non-technical people.  This is a mental burden.  
Because it requires PRIVATE KEY, we do not want to submit the form to the server.  Here comes AuthMan. 

* Process in local, no installation.
* Intuitive GUI
* Both Authentication and Validation
* License Free (BSD / Apache Liceense)

## HowTo
Simply open index.html from browser.  Tested on Chrome.  It supports both 1-liner key or 64 bytes new line delimited PEM form.  

#CI/CD
